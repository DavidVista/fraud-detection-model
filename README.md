# fraud-detection-model
This project aims to detect fraud transactions by combining Nature-Inspired Computing (NIC) algorithms (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization) with traditional Machine Learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).

# Checkpoint I
During the first several weeks, we loaded the dataset and prepared data for further manipulation. Specifically, the dataset was loaded, and the tables were merged for further feature engineering. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/DavidVista/fraud-detection-model/blob/exploration/data_extraction.ipynb">notebook</a> in the branch <a href="https://github.com/DavidVista/fraud-detection-model/tree/exploration">exploration</a> to follow the next steps that have been made:
- Imputing missing values;
- Distribution analysis;
- Removing redundant features;
- Encoding categorical features;
- Creating a learning baseline for the model.
